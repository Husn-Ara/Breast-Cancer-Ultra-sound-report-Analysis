# Breast-Cancer-Ultra-sound-report-Analysis
## Streamlit Application using Python Libraries

I have build an Ultrasound solution that can detect the type and location of different pathologies.
This Application Identify the presence of a specific pathology on the ultrasound image and provide the location of the pathology with bounding box coordinates and mask. Ultrasound is a relatively inexpensive and portable modality of diagnosis of life-threatening diseases and for use in point of care. This will assist to deliver impactful and feasible medical solutions to countries where there are significant resource challenges.

Visualizations help highlight the tumor location and give us the intensity of the tumor at each point in AOI (Area of Interest).

The app takes the image and mask generated from a model as input and gives us the bounded box, mask outline, and heatmap.
